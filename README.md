## Command Line Mode

### Install issue2md CLI Tool

```bash
$ go install github.com/bigwhite/issue2md/cmd/issue2md@latest
```

### Convert Issues to Markdown

The tool supports three modes of operation:

1. **Single Issue Download**
```bash
issue2md <issue-url> [output-dir]
```
Example:
```bash
issue2md https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 downloads
```

2. **Batch Download from File**
```bash
issue2md -f <urls-file> [output-dir]
```
Example:
```bash
issue2md -f issues.txt downloads
```
The `urls-file` should contain one issue URL per line. Lines starting with # are ignored.

3. **Download All Issues from Repository**
```bash
issue2md -r <repo-url> [output-dir]
```
Example:
```bash
issue2md -r https://github.com/owner/repo downloads
```

### Important Notes

1. **Output Directory**
   - By default, files are saved to the `downloads` directory
   - You can specify a different directory as the last argument

2. **GitHub API Rate Limits**
   - Without authentication: 60 requests per hour
   - With authentication: 5,000 requests per hour
   - Each issue requires 2 API requests (one for issue details, one for comments)

3. **GitHub Token**
   - To avoid rate limits, set your GitHub token:
     ```bash
     # Windows
     set GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token
     
     # Linux/Mac
     export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token
     ```
   - You can create a token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Without a token, batch downloads will be limited to 30 issues

4. **Features**
   - Automatically skips existing files
   - Shows progress and statistics
   - Random delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
   - Supports resuming interrupted downloads
